Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The state department has said that. I think that's been proven, but I am happy -- in fact, I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity and I'm so proud of the work that it does. I could talk for the rest of the debate. I know I don't have the time to do that, but just briefly the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV AIDS to afford treatment and that's about half of all the people in the world that are getting treatment in partnership with the American health association.
