Daily News |  Ursinus receives $11 million donation, its largest, for student scholarships

The pledge excerpts a 1784 letter from Ben Franklin to Benjamin Webb, in which Franklin declined repayment for a loan and instead encouraged his recipient to “pay it forward,” a mentality that helped to define Franklin as the founding father of American philanthropy.

Fittingly, the gift was announced on Benjamin Franklin’s birthday, to acknowledge a “pay-it-forward” pledge that each Abele Scholar makes when selected for the program. #PAproud #Ursinus #Ursinus150

As we celebrate our sesquicentennial, our long tradition of philanthropy and service continues with a proud “pay it forward” moment. Joan & Will Abele '61 have pledged $11 million to #Ursinus! Visit our Facebook page for a video about the largest gift in our history. #Ursinus150

I had a lovely first semester @UrsinusCollege. Students are fab, and @NicholasScovil4 is an incredible chair. And it's the first time I've been at an institution whose values align with mine (openness, inclusivity, kindness, growth mindset). That makes for much smoother sailing.

In addition to the "grammable" moments of #studyabroad, the inconveniences of adjusting to life in a different country are also a big part of the experience. Hear from @UrsinusCollege Student Ellie on what she learned from them
